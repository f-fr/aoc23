# Advent of Code 2023

My solution, this time in zig.

The following build targets are supported

  - `zig build runXX` where `XX` is the number of the day (01..24), run the code for day XX
  - `zig build test` runs all unit tests
  - `zig build times` runs all codes in `ReleaseFast` mode with timings.
